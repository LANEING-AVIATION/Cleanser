# Cleanser: The Dawn of LANEING AVIATION's Learning Space

Welcome to **Cleanser**, a repository that marks the inception of LANEING AVIATION's ambitious journey in programming and beyond. Since September 2023, we've been meticulously preparing for this moment, and on September 2, 2024, we finally embarked on our first Cleanser cycle. This fall, we dive into the depths of ACM/ICPC programming, laying the foundation for future technological advancements.

## Project Overview

**Cleanser** is more than just a project; it's a pursuit of coding excellence, democracy, and peace. Our first phase revolves around structured learning and hands-on programming sessions.

### Schedule

- **Programming Days:** Every Monday and Wednesday
- **Session Duration:** Four periods per day, each lasting 45 minutes

The journey started with high hopes but faced immediate challenges. On the first day, we encountered the limitations of our initial setup: Android tablets running AOSP12 struggled with the demands of C++ programming, rendering the experience both frustrating and uninspiring. However, we turned this setback into a learning opportunity—a warm-up for what was to come.

### Strategic Adjustments

Recognizing the need for more robust hardware, we pivoted to using a high-performance Windows laptop stationed in a cool, air-conditioned room. The laptop runs VMware with an Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine configured with ROS Noetic, connected via TeamViewer. By using a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse with the tablet, we remotely accessed the virtual environment to maintain a stable and productive workflow.

This setup, while functional, is not without its flaws. The virtual machine's performance lags behind our expectations, and the streaming experience can be choppy, reducing efficiency. However, this is a work in progress, and I am optimistic about making improvements as we move forward.

### Cleanser's Purpose

The Cleanser project aims to build a solid foundation in ROS, equipping us with the knowledge necessary for developing LANEING AVIATION's future UAV control solutions—specifically, the **Anniecopter**. This project is a stepping stone towards achieving our broader vision of integrating cutting-edge technology into autonomous flight systems.

### Looking Ahead

As of September 2, the initial ACM programs have been successfully uploaded to the repository. I plan to continue updating the repository with content from each programming session, though this may not strictly follow a set schedule. Each update brings us closer to mastering the tools and skills necessary for our ambitious goals.

Wish me luck as I continue to navigate this journey of discovery and innovation!
